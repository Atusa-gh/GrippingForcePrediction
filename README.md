# GrippingForcePrediction
Repository for gripping force prediction with the goal of gripping control of a hand prosthesis

1. Recording both EMG raw signals and gripping force simultaneously during precision-type gripping

     EMG signals are recorded via a Myo armband from Thalmiclabs.
     Gripping force is the Z-axis force measured using a F/T sensor:mini 45 from ATI Industrial Automation Inc.
      
2. Signal processing

3. Dataset

     Data is derived form 10 healthy subjects with an average age of 23.8 years old (9 males and one female)
